            </span>
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3 style="text-align: left;">
            <span>How to Play Snow Rider Game:</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: large;"><span><b>1. Choose Your Rider and Customize Your Gear:</b> Before you hit
                the
                slopes, the first thing you’ll do is select your rider. You can customize
                your character with a variety of outfits, snowboards, and accessories to
                create a look that’s as unique as your snowboarding style. Once your
                character is ready, you’ll get to pick the perfect snowboard to enhance your
                performance, whether you prefer speed, agility, or stability.</span>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: large;"><span><b>2. Start the Descent: </b>After customizing your rider, it’s time
                to
                begin the race. You’ll start your journey at the peak of the mountain and
                begin your descent down the snowy slopes. The game is designed to be
                intuitive, and with just a few swipes or taps, you’ll quickly get the hang
                of steering and controlling your rider. As you descend, the mountain will
                present a variety of obstacles, including rocks, trees, and ice patches.
                Your main objective is to maintain speed while avoiding these dangers.</span>
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span style="font-size: large;"><span><b>3. Master the Controls:</b> Snow Rider’s controls are simple and
                user-friendly. Whether you’re playing on a mobile device or console, you’ll
                be able to steer your rider using either touch controls or gamepad buttons.
                Use the left and right controls to guide your snowboarder, and swipe or
                press buttons to perform tricks such as spins, flips, and grinds. The more
                stunts you pull off in mid-air, the higher your score will be!</span>
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span style="font-size: large;"><span><b>4. Perform Stunts and Earn Points:</b> One of the most exciting
                aspects
                of Snow Rider is the ability to perform a wide range of tricks and stunts.
                While racing down the mountain, take advantage of ramps and jumps to perform
                flips, spins, and aerial grabs. Each stunt you land successfully earns you
                points and boosts your score. The game rewards players who can string
                together multiple tricks in a row, adding an element of skill and strategy
                to the gameplay.</span>
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span style="font-size: large;"><span><b>5. Complete Challenges and Unlock New Content:</b> As you progress
                through the game, you'll encounter various challenges that test your
                snowboarding skills. These challenges can range from performing specific
                tricks to collecting hidden items scattered across the mountain. Completing
                these challenges not only boosts your score but also unlocks new levels,
                snowboards, outfits, and other rewards. The more challenges you complete,
                the more customization options you gain, allowing you to further personalize
                your rider and equipment.</span>
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span style="font-size: large;"><span><b>6. Progress Through Levels and Different Terrain: </b>The game
                features
                multiple levels, each offering a unique set of challenges and terrain. From
                the smooth, wide-open slopes of the lower mountain to the treacherous, icy
                cliffs near the summit, each level introduces new obstacles and a different
                environment. Some areas feature steep drops, narrow paths, and tight
                corners, requiring quick reflexes and careful navigation. The difficulty
                gradually increases as you progress, ensuring that the game remains
                challenging and engaging throughout.</span>
